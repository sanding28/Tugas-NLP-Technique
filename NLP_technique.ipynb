seems like that s something new  you know  keys  i know what you re thinking  okay  you should not talk to antwan  i just think it s important to be transparent  okay  uh uh  no  antwan is deep in the sequel launch  he s either not gonna care or he s gonna get pissed and then he s gonna blame us  so  i don t know what you haven t figured out about the whole situation  also  aren t you some kinda mit genius  indie game designer  what are you doing down here dealing with complaints  that  mouser  is a long and pathetic story involving failed dreams  desperation  and a mountain of college debt  you do not wanna hear about that  you re absolutely right  that story sounds horrible and boring and full of white privilege  don t talk to antwan   keys  we never dreamt this would ve happened  i mean  life itself  it s essentially a fishbowl game  people aren t playing it  they re watching it grow  it s a strictly observational experience where computer generated characters interact and evolve  i thought we d be lucky to give it away  that s what s so charming about ',\n",

between the two of you  has this evolved into more than  millie  no    no way  no  it s strictly platonic  no  no  no  we re friends  we re like best friends  friendship  and now your game is gonna be released by soonami  one of the biggest publishers in the world  it s crazy  actually  it is  yeah  it does seem a little bit like an unlikely pairing  though  keys  yeah  i didn t totally get it either  but millie s got a real instinct for these things  millie  antwan is a genius  he s brash and obnoxious  but he s really good at what he does  it s a chance for our work to be seen by a wider audience  god  those two were young and dumb  jeez  so we re breaking and entering now  how does it feel working for a galactic black hole of frozen shit  you have to leave  i can t talk to you  aw  shame will have that effect  no  millie  i mean i can t talk to you  i can t even see you  i m literally focusing on background objects because looking at your lips move violates my nda and it could get me fired  aw  fired by antwan  the guy who stole our work  no  he bought it and then he shelved it  all right  you re living in the past  you are stuck  you gotta move on  how can i move on  how can you  antwan swiped our ai engine to use in his dumb shooter  did he  millie  because honestly  i m not so sure  our game was complex and beautiful and interesting and free city  it may be popular  but it s so idiotic  it makes me wanna cry  then stop defending him and help me beat his ass  millie  i m  come on  keys  he stole from us  and now he s lying about it so he doesn t have to give us

the cripple says to the homosexual  whoa  stop  stop  stop  where did you hear that  a robbery  the gunman told it to the driver who thought it was hilarious  so i memorized it and told everyone  word of advice  don t crib your jokes from the trolls of free city  trolls  is that a swing set  holy  molotovgirl  okay  this is too weird  vintage mariah  bubble gum ice cream  and now swings  this is too weird  i thought the same thing  too  i thought the same thing  when i was younger  i was obsessed with swings  growing up in my family  it was    you don t wanna hear this  no  oh  i wanna hear everything    oh  growing up in my family  it wasn t good enough to be great  you had to win  and that pressure  you know  it was just constant  but when i was in the backyard on that little swing  you know that moment  that split second between rising and falling  when you re totally weightless  it feels like you re free  in love  free  what you said  yeah  i really wanna kiss you  is that weird  you want to kiss me  i wanna kiss you so badly  you want to kiss me badly  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  i wanna kiss you well  i mean  i m an idiot  so i say things like an idiot sometimes  no  you re not  you re not  i mean  um  uh  if you know how to  go for it  i know how  okay  here it goes      that was so much better than ice cream    whoa  i think someone s at the door  i ll say  well  this was great  yeah  it was  let s meet up again sometime soon  yeah  yes  definitely  maybe in the real world  what  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  okay  bye  okay  bye  molotov  hey  my real name is millie  my real name continues to be guy    keys  millie  open up  millie  it s me  it s keys  open up  come on    millie  it s me  open up  what  you were right  you were right  oh  come on in  you were right  our code  it is in free city and  millie  it works  yeah  i know  but we don t have proof  keys  just forget about that for one second  i m saying that our game  life itself  where characters would grow and change and feel real  yeah   worked  keys  the ai worked  it s the reason why free city is so realistic and people love it so much  and of course it doesn t look the same  there s no waterfalls  there s no butterflies and unicorns  all the characters have different skins  of course they do  but the underlying code in the game is the same  our code  and guy  i mean  he has evolved way further than we thought was even possible  wait  are you talking about the hacker in the npc skin  millie  i m talking about the fact that blue shirt guy  millie  yeah   is not a player  he is an algorithm who thinks he s alive  i mean  hell  technically  he is alive  he is the first real artificial intelligence    no  no  keys  i know  no  no  no  yeah  yeah  guy  my guy  keys  guy  one who has been  your guy  holy  keys  this is a good thing  no  it s really bad  millie  his code  it s thousands of times the size it should be  we did it  mills  we did it  everything that we wanted to create  it actually happened  okay  did you know that the npcs have private lives  one of the baristas learned how to make a cappuccino through trial and error  i mean  that s really difficult  i can t even do that  i can t even froth my own oat milk in the morning  and the bombshell character in the game wrote a memoir that s a searing indictment of gender roles  the patriarchy  it s a little preachy in parts  but overall  it s pretty good  millie  we have to celebrate  no  this can t be happening  what are you talking about  this is what we ve been working for  no  i let him kiss me  so  yeah    i m sorry  wait  you let who kiss you  millie  guy  guy  the first time i kiss a non toxic guy in like forever and of course he s not even real  uh  there s not a button for that  oh  he found the button  okay  millie  yeah  i am  i m so confused  why is it so hot  keys  and surprisingly curious    you let an artificially intelligent video game character kiss you  oh  okay  can

the game being backwards compatible  i think he s lying about free city    what are you talking about  keys  look  you see  there s not one mission  not one location  i mean  there s not even a single character from free city   on here  free city   is not an update  it s a replacement  exactly  so when free city   launches on monday  blue shirt guy  all proof of our code  everything will be deleted  he can t do that  i mean  this is artificial life we re dealing with  i mean  that s insane    we re screwed  maybe not  if we can find our original build in the game  it ll prove that antwan used our code without properly licensing it  and we just have to find it before free city   launches  we have   hours  i ve looked  keys  you know i have  i know you have  but now that we both know about blue shirt guy  maybe he can help  that would mean i d have to tell him  millie  he s not gonna exist once the sequel launches  his whole world s about to end  don t you think he d want a chance to

              "  ' through guy s code and there is something there  even now  after the wipe  what s the point  guy was  like  a one in a billion miracle  we can t replicate that  i tried  okay  you were right  it s over  no  millie  millie  you re not listening to me  all right  a reboot  it doesn t erase his ai coding  you literally would have to destroy the servers to do that  his ai is still there  it just needs to be accessed  i ve seen him  keys  he s forgotten everything  just look at the trace log i sent you  it ll explain everything      now  from the beginning  guy s behavior is much more complex than it should be  thanks to our code    but he s still stuck in free city  he s still stuck in this life  this loop  and then  something changes  he comes to life  why  and then i remembered  one of the characters from life itself was this guy that i nicknamed lovelorn  and he was someone who was designed to never meet the right person  it was essentially the building blocks of the character  but he never stopped hoping that he would meet  the girl of his dreams   so i had to base this girl off of someone  and who better than the person that i was sitting next to every day  you  but then  one day  he meets you in free city  and once he sees you  he can never be the same  he was supposed to feel doomed  but instead  he feels alive  until eventually  he is alive  you changed him  millie  you changed his code  and i think you can do it again  you brought him to life  millie  you brought him to life  and he was alive because he met the one person    don t have a good day  have a great day  customer  thank you  take care    female voice  everybody down on the ground  nobody try to be a hero  this will all be over soon  okay  female voice  everybody except you

i d forgotten why  do you see that  right there  millie  oh  my god    oh  my god  antwan hid our original build past the horizon  making it invisible  but he forgot to scrub the reflections  it s still out there  guy  we just can t see it  if we can get there  that is the evidence we need  you can t go past the water line  i tried  we need help  keys  antwan found a way to hide it in plain sight in the one place no one can even get to    i can t even believe he s smart enough to be this diabolical  keys  i need you to focus  okay  so  the reflection shows the build past the southern horizon  but the game physics won t allow you past the beach  but you think you can find a way to get us past the collision mesh  keys  we re gonna need a bridge  you just get to hitman s beach and i

about binary  tom  it s bigger than that  this is about our future  which is a sticky subject  given our past  what do you mean  how s the therapy  good  any  episodes  no  that s terrific  look  tom  i know we ve always had our differences  what did you say about our first meeting  we had all the chemistry of an fbi interrogation      but look at this place  we did this  together  yeah  now what  things have changed  the market s tough  i m sure you can understand why our beloved parent company  warner bros   has decided to make a sequel to the trilogy  what  they informed me they re gonna do it with or without us  i thought they couldn t do that    oh  they can  and they made it clear they ll kill our contract if we don t cooperate  really  i know you said the story was over for you  but that s the thing about stories  they never really end  do they  we re still telling the same stories we ve always told  just with different names  different faces and i have to say i m kind of excited  after all these years  to be going back to where it all started  back to the matrix  i ve spoken to marketing        tom  yeah  are you all right    yeah    what were you feeling at that point  what was i feeling  i felt either i m having a mental breakdown again or i m living inside a computer generated reality that has imprisoned me  again      not much of a choice  no  maybe it s not as binary as that  maybe there are other ways to understand what happened  yeah  thomas  you are a suicide survivor gifted with a powerful imagination  those facts have combined to create dangerous fictions in your life  yesterday  you walked into a meeting with your business partner and he ambushed you  demanding you make a game you said you would never make  this attack effectively took away your voice  his violence triggered you and your mind fought back  you did to him what he was doing to you  we ve talked about the value of adaptive anger in healing trauma  far from suggesting a repeat of your initial breakdown  i believe this episode demonstrates healthy self protection  and more importantly  i remember how hard it was for you to share something like this  which tells me just how far we ve come    do you need a refill on your prescription    yeah        first of all  i know i speak for everyone when i say that i m so  so excited to be working on a game that was such a  well  game

agents  they use bots now  skinned as normal people  which means they re everywhere and you never know who to trust  why should i trust you  because if they open that door  we lose our hack  i will be caught and killed and you will be put right back on that treadmill they designed for you  just like they did the last time you tried to leap your way out  i know why you left your modal open  you needed someone else to free morpheus  and it s because of him that we were able to get to you  i know these things the same way that i knew one day i would find you  and that when i did  you would be

this happened    but if it did  then we died  obviously not  why the machines kept you alive and why they went to such lengths to hide you are questions we don t have answers to  hide me  i ve been at a company making a game called the matrix  doesn t seem like they were trying to hide anything  we ve been tracking that company for years  we screened every thomas anderson we found  what we didn t understand was that they could alter your dsi  pods generate your digital self image through a feedback system called semblance  this is how you look to yourself  somehow they were able to alter your dsi loop  this is how everyone else sees you    twenty years  why did it take   years to find me  it took a lot longer than that  it s been over   years since you and trinity flew to one of the machine cities  what  there s so much we don t know  like why you ve barely aged  or how many times they ve altered your dsi    but based on what we do know  it appears no one found you because you didn t want to be found  that s not true    maybe it isn t  maybe there s no foundation to the rumors that you disappeared  because you were working with the machines from the beginning  morpheus

agent smith  a combo pack of counterprogramming that was    let s just say  more than a little bit crazy making  but it worked because here we are  now  for the bad news  your brain is hooked on this shit the matrix has been force feeding you for years  hooked bad  you re going through major withdrawals  docbots are giving you crap odds for surviving  but  see  they don t know you like i do  i know exactly what you need    you gotta be kidding  uh uh  no joke  could be this is the first day of the rest of your life  but if you want it     you gotta fight for it  no  i m done fighting  are you                what the hell is he doing  oh  yeah  they taught you good    made you believe their world was all you deserved  but some part of you knew that was a lie  some part of you remembered what was real  you don t know me  no      ooh            i know you  because i know the only thing that still matters to you  i know it s why you re here  why you re still fighting and why you will never give up          come on  neo  this is it  this is your last chance        you gotta fight for your goddamn life if you want to see trinity again    come on  neo  fight for her  holy shit  fight for her          hey  hey  mind if i  how are you doing  if this plug is actually real  that means they took my life    and turned it into a video game  how am i doing  i don t know  i don t even know how to know  that s it  isn t it  if we don t know what s real  we can t resist  they took your story  something that meant so much to people like me  and turned it into something trivial  that s what the matrix does  it weaponizes every idea  every dream  everything that s important to us  where better to bury truth than inside something as ordinary as a video game  that sounds like the oracle    heard so much about her  she was gone before i was free  gone  when this new version of the matrix was uploaded  there was a purge    they promised peace and they gave us purge  no  no  there was peace  you made it possible  and it changed everything  doesn t feel like it changed anything  the matrix is the same or worse  and i m back where i started  it feels like everything i did  everything we did     like none of it mattered  all of it mattered  i can show you  this is my crew  our operator  seq  sequoia  but everybody calls me seq  nice to meet you  dad loved redwoods  when he escaped the matrix and found out they no longer existed  it almost killed him  lucky  he met mom and here i am  this is lexy  berg and ellster  hi  you knew my grandfather  captain roland  roland was your grandfather  he always laughed  joking how he never believed in you  but  in private  he said that you freed his mind a second time  uh  not to fanboy out here  but this is kind of a huge moment for me  berg is our resident neo ologist  a what  there s a lot of people out there like me who are a little bit obsessed with your life  i would never have recognized your modal if it weren t for him  whenever you re feeling up for it  i ve got  like  a million questions  me too  starting with them    it s okay  come meet him  this is cybebe  that s octacles  that s      machines are on our side now  they are synthients  it s a word they prefer to  machines   your contact with the synthient city had a huge impact on their world    that s what i meant  what you changed that nobody believed could ever be changed  the meaning of  our side     cybebe and octacles risked their lives to help get you out  thank you  but why    not all seek to control  just as not all wish to be free  what is that  an exomorphic particle codex  it s pretty new  it gives programs access to this world  within limits  limits are the domain of the limited  morpheus  thank you  it was my honor    wow    how does it work  paramagnetic oscillation  if you want  i can download the codex manual for you  sure  downloading used to be fun  now it s all manuals and diagnostics  can i ask the',\n",
              "  'm something  when you unplugged me  there was another pod    yes  we ve analyzed the data  it could be trinity  it s her  i figured we were going to have this conversation  look  you were not a typical flush and grab  you were in this weird tower that cybebe had never accessed  and she s now exiled  we burned our one shot for you  even if it were trinity and she wanted to be free  we have no idea how to do it  yet  nobody believed we d ever find him  but we did  okay  we don t know how to get her out  yet  captain  we re approaching security clearance  we re here  zion  have a seat  this is hanno  best pilot in our fleet  quite a few synthients deserve that title before me    mnemosyne  you are cleared for landing  welcome home    thank you  control  um  we re about to crash      general realized we were never going to beat the sentinels  so  we just got better at hiding from them  welcome to io  io    wow  that looks real  bio sky  works kind of like grow lights  it s way more complex than that  it pulls water from the crust  hydronating the air  it balances the eco and our sri cycles  plus    it is pretty to look at  as opposed to that  i guess the general sent us a welcome party  god damn  it is you  niobe  a few more wrinkles and a few less teeth  but wise enough to know i don t know anything  i sure as shit never saw this coming  neither did i  i told you he was alive  captain  you and your crew have been grounded  general  if you d just let me explain  the protocols are put in place for everyone s protection  i m sorry  i saw an opportunity and i was afraid we d lose him  but  general  people have been waiting for so long  we found the one  i don t believe in the one  i never did  no  me neither  but there was a time when you trusted me with your ship  against the council s orders  the world was different then  we were different  report to the docks  scrub down the mnemosyne  transfer your access codes  you are done  captain    we need to talk    when word first came that it actually might be you  i didn t know how i would feel in this moment  it is nice to see you  it s good to see you too    a long way from dozer s paint stripper    yes  a lot has changed  except maybe you  you remember this    it s so easy to forget how much noise the matrix pumps into your head until you unplug    yeah  something else makes the same kind of noise  takes over every damn thing  just like the matrix  war  i stood at the barricade of the temple  staring at the army of sentinels  waiting for them to kill every one of us  but then  they left  they said you saved us  i didn t believe it  every night i would dream of attack sirens  but then  i would wake up to this  silence  i m ashamed of it now  my pessimism of how long it took me to believe a world without war was possible  you gave me that  you gave that gift to us all  and it is the gift that continues to bear fruit  come help me get up  let s take a walk      oh  beautiful  this is freya  head of botany  and this is quillion  our lead digitologist  i presume our guest needs no introduction  nothing travels faster than light  except gossip    welcome to the garden  neo  a strawberry  using digital code from the matrix  we retro convert it into dna sequences  and they grow here  it s not easy augmenting the genome to photosynthesize bio sky  but  we re getting there    go ahead  try it    we re quite excited about the blueberries  you remember that shit we used to eat  that slop that tasted like rust  zion could have never made something like this  why  because we needed synthients and di like him  zion was stuck in the past  stuck in war  stuck in a matrix of its own  they believed that it had to be us or them  this city was built by us and them  what happened to zion  i ve been waiting for you to ask that question  all of the troubles started in the machine cities  power plants were unable to produce enough energy  nothing can breed violence like scarcity  for the first time  we saw machines at war with one other  we got word from the oracle of a new power rising  that was the last we heard from her  morpheus    after the siege  he was elected unanimously  high chair of the council  oh  how he loved that    but as rumors of this new power spread  he ignored them  he was certain what you had done could not be undone  all of these people never stopped believing in miracles  believing in you  i m sorry  how could i know this would happen  we didn t understand all of it back then  no more than we do now  i didn t come here to cause you problems  niobe  but i need your help  trinity is alive  then there is another question  why did they keep her alive  i can t answer that  but if there s a chance i can free her  i have to try  even if it means endangering everyone in this city  i m sorry  neo  i won t let what happened to zion happen to io  i hope you ll forgive an old woman for asking you to go with sheperd  here  till we have better understanding of what s going on  you re going to imprison me after i just got free  i know it doesn t seem fair  but neither does growing old  but you don t hear me comp',\n",
              "  'laining    sorry  i ve never met a legend before  neo  sheperd      crazy  you re real   real   there s that word again    people talk a lot about the old days  about you  the viral agent  the siege of zion  everything was simpler back then  people wanted to be free  it s different now  sometimes it feels like people gave up  like the matrix won    this is you  and i gotta ask you one thing  is it true you could fly  cool        morpheus  oh  general stuck you in the rapunzel tower    on the upside  it s a nice view  what happened to bugs and the others  they re supposed to be sterilizing the mnemosyne with a toothbrush   supposed to be   well  i could tell you that they re standing by  waiting for you to make the choice to remain meekly incarcerated or bust the hell out of here and go and find trinity  but that ain t a choice      general  what should we do    bugs has the same independence of mind she had the day you freed her  this is not independence of mind  it s mutiny    come on   be  i know how much you hated locking him up  just like i know there s a part of you that s relieved now that he s gone  we ve worked so hard to keep io safe  this scares me  that s her    on the bridge  got her    it s sick how the semblance works  you see flashes of the real her  but  the way she reads  code wise  she s pure bluepill  this is a tough question  neo  but it has to be asked  what if she s happy where she is  how did i read  exactly like her  take us to broadcast depth    thank you for helping me  most of us are here because of you  i also admit our only chance to get out of the general s doghouse is for you to find your mojo  what if i can t be what i once was  then we re all fucked      two minutes  two minutes to broadcast    i slipped you in through a hotel room    should be safe  portal s open  closest i could get you is the warehouse near her garage  whole zone s crawling with bots  let s go  so  what do you think of him  i was kinda worried at first because he s so much older  the beard  the hair  oh  no  totally works for me    you idiot  i mean  the one  thing  you know  everyone that shipped with him died  oh  yeah  he s gonna get us all killed  for sure    predictable as ever  smith  smith  as in   the  smith    this is so insane  there s so many theories about the two of them and they re standing right there  this code is freaky  he s like an agent  but not  an appeal to reason  how did you find us  you never appreciated our relationship  not like the analyst  the what  my doctor  he used our bond and turned it into a chain  it s so obvious once you see it  right  but this whole altered code update really blew my mind  i still don t know how he did it  you  as a balding nerd  hilarious  and me    even more perfect  maybe a little too far on the piercing blue eyes  what do you think  what do you want  smith  i have such dreams  tom  big dreams  well  mostly just extremely violent revenge fantasies  but in order for me to pursue mine  i need to dissuade you from pursuing yours  hmm  sounds like conflict  inevitable  doesn t have to be  all you have to do is stay out of the matrix  and leave the good doctor to me  you can have him  i m here for trinity  that s the trouble  tom  he knew you d come  just like i did    trust me  you re not ready for him  captain  i m reading portals from the lower frequencies  i won t have his leash on my neck again  i found some old acquaintances of yours  bugs        exiles  i thought they were all purged    you    oh  it is you    all these years  i can t believe it  oh  god  you stole my life      what the merv is trying to say  is that their situation is a little bit like mine  to have their lives back  yours has to end    kill him        you ruined every suck my silky ass thing  we had grace  we had style  we had conversation  not this          art  films  books were all better  originality mattered  you gave us face zucker suck and cock me climateywiki piss and shit          i still know kung fu  neo      just like old times          neo  i ve been thinking about us  tom  look how binary is the form  the nature of things  ones and zeros    light and dark  choice and its absence    anderson and smith      you ve lost something  tom  you re not what you used to be  it s true      nice one  thanks  come on  neo        captain  you okay  yeah  where s neo  smith is killing him    where    i feel bad about this  tom  after all  you are the one who set me free  again  so  you  more than anyone  understands why i can t go back    you should have listened to me  now you ll never see her again        what was that  that was neo  mojo rising        you all right  yeah  it s gonna trigger a response  i got multiple exits ready    this is not over yet  our sequel franchise spinoff        we should go  i can t  i have to talk to her  neo  those exiles were older than you  and we barely handled them    you really wanna do this now  i mean  you look like shit    oh  my god  what  what happened  an accident    kush  call a doctor  it s fine  i don t have a lot of time  i wasn t sure i d see you again  after we',\n",
              "  ' spoke  i realized  my life wasn t a life  at some point  i think i gave up searching for something real  wait  something happened  i looked for you at the coffee shop  i began to wonder if i imagined you  and then last night i had a dream  in the dream  you were surrounded by police  then they started chasing us  us  you were on my bike with me  how did it end  not good  i ve had dreams that weren t just dreams  you mean a dream that came true      finally  we can talk like adults  i hate lying  i do  it exhausts me  tiff and i have been waiting for you  like  forever    deja vu  right  oh  no use  you can t beat time  this rewind is happening faster than you can blink  you gave me the idea  allow me to sum up our goal in a single word   bullet time     i know  kind of ironic  using the power that defined you to control you    i kept such a close eye on you and still you found a way out  clever monkey  using that modal  call me an optimist  but this could all be for the best  the skin s not looking too bad this time  i know some of this will be difficult for you to hear  after everything you went through  all that pain and suffering  only to learn the world doesn t end when you do  surprise    i was there when you died    i said to myself   here is the anomaly of anomalies   what an extraordinary opportunity  first  i had to convince the suits to let me rebuild the two of you  why her  getting there  and don t worry  she can t hear me  resurrecting you both was crazy expensive  like renovating a house  took twice as long  cost twice as much    i thought you d be happy to be alive again  so wrong      did you know hope and despair are nearly identical in code    we worked for years  trying to activate your source code  i was about to give up  when i realized  trinity   it was never just you  alone  neither of you is of any particular value    like acids and bases  you re dangerous when mixed together  every sim where you two bonded  let s just say bad things happened  neo  however  as long as i managed to keep you close  but not too close  i discovered something incredible  now  my predecessor loved precision  his matrix was all fussy facts and equations  he hated the human mind  so he never bothered to realize that you don t give a shit about facts  it s all about fiction  the only world that matters is the one in here  and you people believe the craziest shit  why  what validates and makes your fictions real  feelings  allow me  kush  here  is one of my handlers  they re everywhere  such a pain  cloning agents over a coppertop  far more effective just to saturate a population  and  bonus  swarm mode is sick fun      ooh  nicely done  you ever wonder why you have nightmares  why your own brain tortures you  it s actually us  maximizing your output  it works just like this  oh  no  can you stop the bullet  if only you could move faster    here s the thing about feelings  they re so much easier to control than facts  turns out  in my matrix  the worse we treat you  the more we manipulate you  the more energy you produce  it s nuts    i ve been setting productivity records every year since i took over  and  the best part  zero resistance  people stay in their pods  happier than pigs in shit  the key to it all  you  and her  quietly yearning for what you don t have  while dreading losing what you do  for      of your race  that is the definition of reality  desire and fear  baby  just give the people what they want  right    she s the only home you have  thomas  come home before something terrible happens        bugs  i hear him      trinity  you shouldn t call me that  i m sorry  i have to go  but i ll be back  neo  time to go      sentinels  worse    general ordered me to look after the ship  so you shadowed us  check your long range scans  squids are combing this area  he s right  you can stay here and die  or come back and face a court martial  and you call that a choice    sheperd should have left you to the squids  i m too damn old to sit through some boring ass trial  niobe  don t blame bugs  do shut your mouth  do address me as general  and do not rob my ex captain of her agency  which she exercised with her own particular brand of shortsighted stupidity  shortsighted  you care more about growing fruit than freeing minds  we are not going to have this argument again  it s not an argument  it s a fact  you gave up on people  i tell you what i m going to give up on and it s you  sheperd  get her out of my sight  general  disarm  kujaku s a friend    hello  friend    okay  him  general  thank you for seeing me  i figured if there was anyone who could make sense of this mess  it would be you  hello  neo  i know you  i tried to keep my eye on you    why  we met a long time ago  good morning  sati  my father knew we d meet again  though he would have wished for happier circumstances  his inadvertent role in what happened to you was the greatest regret of his life  i don t understand  my father was the chief engineer at the anomaleum    the what  my father designed the resurrection pods where neo and trinity were imprisoned    i m sorry  yo',\n",
              "  'u knew what happened to him  you knew that he and trinity both were alive  and you didn t tell me  there were times i doubted my decision  niobe  but io needed you  this city needed to be built for your people as well as mine  if i would have told you everything  you would have had a very difficult choice to make  my friends let me make my own choices  if it was a mistake  you have my deepest apologies  why are you here now  neo s escape has destabilized the matrix  the anomaleum draws its current from trinity alone now  a fail safe has been triggered to reset the matrix back to the previous version  but the analyst halted the reset  he s convinced the authorities that you will soon return voluntarily  and why would he say that  because if i don t go back  he ll kill trinity  faced with returning to your pod or enduring trinity s death again  what would you choose  neo  i ll go back  well  the analyst knows you well  but that knowledge has made him incautious  after you escaped  he should have accepted his losses and devacuated trinity  but that would have prevented this extraordinary opportunity that now exists before us  a few hours ago  no one would have been able to convince me that i would be standing here  trying to explain a mission as crazy as this one  what are you doing  volunteering  oh  no  you are the one captain that i am ordering to go  now you don t have to order me  general   cause i m volunteering  i need two more  are you out of your minds  you don t even know what it is  general  we know you  if you say this is important  none of us is choosing to stay home  thank you  knuckle up  and good luck        trinity is held in the anomaleum  which is in this transmission tower  the passages used to rescue neo are now sealed and a legion of sentinels patrols the tower  so  stealth will be paramount  as long as we raise no alarms  this first part of the mission should be the easiest  you mean crossing the fetus fields  sneaking across an entire power plant  climbing a two kilometer tower guarded by thousands of sentinels  that s the easy part  exactly so  because all we have to do is convince someone who does this every day to take one of us along      fifty meters below the anomaleum is a stratum of amniotic filters  hidden along this edge is a small hexagonal vent  this vent feeds the air intake into the corpuscular modifier  which oxygenates the bio gel used in neo s pod  i get it  the exomorph slinkies up neo s old umbilicus  what could go wrong          once inside  morpheus will use the system operator to open the devacuator line and disengage the macerators    in order to unplug trinity s body  while her mind still remains connected to the matrix  i m gonna need a second human brain to implement the bypass  and since neo must be with the analyst  the only available mind that s a near enough match is yours  figures    thanks  cybebe    does trinity still have to take the red pill  since kujaku and i are transferring her consciousness onto the ship  it s not strictly necessary  but what matters is that this is her choice  extracting a confused or an uncertain mind will  in all probability  kill her  but even if it is what she wants  won t the analyst just order the sentinels to stop you  he will  but if my plan works  it won t matter  why  because we ll already be gone  somebody thinks this hard about a plan  there has to be a reason why  when my father realized how the anomaleum was going to be used  he covertly transferred the designs to me  the analyst discovered his betrayal and had my parents purged    i would have been murdered too if it wasn t for kujaku  not a day goes by that i don t grieve them  i ve been praying for this day for a very long time    we re coming up on broadcast  i thought you should know that i m here because of her  all i ever wanted was to be as fearless as trinity  but i saw how she reacted in the garage  and i  you re wondering if i m wrong  what if we re too late  what if she s not trinity anymore    i never believed i was the one  but she did  she believed in me  it s my turn to believe in her        this is where it gets tricky  have you ever done an operation like this  not yet    here we go    welcome home  all i want is to talk to her  do you mean tiff  come back  and you can talk to her as often as you like  i mean  handsome chad may have something to say about it  if she tells me this is what she wants  you win  really  but if she wants me  then you ll let us go free  and why would i do something as stupid as that  right now  i m on a ship full of people who will unplug me before they ll let you take me back  if you want this matrix  this is your only chance  but how do i know they won t unplug you anyway  same way i know you ll let us walk out of here    okay  i like tests  we ll let tiff decide      that s it  bypass is ready  now what  we wait  doesn t it seem crazy to come all this way and leave her here  we must abide by her decision  and if she says no  what happens to neo  at this time  the most important choice of neo s life is not his to make    i saw this in my dream  if i w',\n",

you think you hold all the cards  because you can do whatever you want in this world  i say  go for it  remake it  knock yourselves out  paint the sky with rainbows  but here s the thing  the sheeple aren t going anywhere  they like my world  they don t want this sentimentality  they don t want freedom or empowerment  they want to be controlled  they crave the comfort of certainty  and that means you two  back in your pods  unconscious and alone  just like them    we re not here to negotiate anything  we were on our way to remake your world  change a few things  i kind of like the  paint the

              "  'e you anything    because he s my father  my mother worked at the   below  just like anni  she used to take me there when i was a little girl  to the club  yeah  i hid out in the dressing room while she worked  used to see him there  he scared the shit out of me  and i could never understand why he looked at me the way he did  then one night  my mother told me who he was  when i was seven  my mother was murdered  strangled  never found out who  probably some creep from the club  anyway  social services came to take me away  and he didn t say a thing  couldn t even look at me  he owes me that money  i m sorry  for what i said  oh  it s all right    you assume the worst in people  which  well  maybe we re not so different after all  who are you under there  what are you hiding  are you just  hideously scarred  yeah    listen to me  if we don t stand up for annika  no one will  all anyone cares about in this place are these white  privileged assholes  the mayor  the commissioner  the da  now thomas and bruce wayne  i mean  as far as i m concerned  that psycho s right to go after these creeps  i think you d be on his side  what do you mean   thomas and bruce wayne   what  do you live in a cave  the riddler s latest  it s all about the waynes  listen  if i can find that dickbag kenzie  will you help me  please  come on  vengeance  just don t make any moves without me  understand  it s a little more dangerous than you know    i told you  baby  i can take care of myself    i m thomas wayne  and i approve this message    from a very young age  my family  martha s family  the arkhams   instilled in both of us that giving back is not just an obligation  it s a passion  that is our family s legacy    the waynes and the arkhams  gotham s founding families  but what is their real legacy  twenty years ago  one reporter set out to uncover the dark truth  he found shocking family secrets  how  when martha was just a child  her mother brutally murdered her father  then committed suicide     and how the arkhams used their power and money to cover it up  how martha herself was in and out of institutions for years and they didn t want anyone to know  thomas wayne tried to force this crusading reporter into a hush money agreement to save his mayoral campaign    but when the reporter refused   wayne turned to longtime secret associate carmine falcone   and had him murdered    the waynes and the arkhams  gotham s legacy of lies and murder  i hope you re listening  bruce wayne  this is your legacy too  and gotham needs you to answer   for the sins of your father  goodbye    do you know who i am  you re bruce wayne  i wanna see carmine falcone  see            who is this guy who invented the ball  right  must have made a fortune  if you think about it  the concept of it  right  briscoe  do you know how much this sweater cost    no  boss          you know why communism failed  right    no  boss    austerity      all right  all right    look at that  perfect    it s never gonna be that good again  hey  johnny slick  what are you doing here  give us a moment here  fellas    come on  see ya  champ  come on  sweetheart  have a seat  i thought i might hear from you  this  uh  riddler son of a bitch is really  stirring things up  huh  is it true  what  that reporter business  what do you want to know here  kid  did you kill him  for my father  look  your father was in trouble  this reporter had some dirt  some very  personal stuff about your mother  her family history  everybody s got their dirty laundry  that s just how it is  but he didn t want none of it coming out  not right before the election  and your father tried to pay the guy off  but he wasn t going for it  so  he came to me  well  i never seen him like that  he said   carmine  i want you to put the fear of god in this guy   and when fear isn t enough  oof  hmm  your father wanted me to handle it  so i did  i handled it  i know  you thought your father was a boy scout  but you d be surprised what even a good man like him is capable of in the right situation  do me a favor  don t lose any sleep over it  this reporter was a lowlife  he was on maroni s payroll  maroni  oh  yeah  he could never stand your father and i had history  and after what happened with that reporter  maroni was worried that your father would be in my pocket  forever  he would have done anything to keep him from becoming mayor  you understand  are you saying salvatore maroni got my father killed  do i know it for a fact  i m just saying  it sure looked that way to me  this is what you wanted  huh  this little conversation here    it s been a long time coming  huh  i mean  you ain t a kid no more            you lied to me  my whole life  i spoke to carmine falcone  he told me what he did for my father  about salvatore maroni  he told you salvatore maroni  had my father killed  why didn t you tell me all this  all these years i ve spent fighting for him  believing that he was a good man  he was a good man  you listen to me  your father was a good man  he made a mistake  a  mistake   he had a man killed  why    to protect his family image  his political aspirations  it wasn t to protect the family image  and he didn t have anyone killed  he was protecting your mother  he didn t care about his image or the campaign  any of that  he cared about her  and you  and in a moment of weakness  he turned to falcone  but he never thought falcone would kill that man  your father should have known that falcone would do anything to finally have something on him that he could use  that s who falcone is  and that was your father s mistake  but when falcone told him what he d done  your father was distraught  he told falcone he was going to the police  that he would confess everything  and that night  your father and your mother were killed    it was falcone    oh  i wish i knew for sure  or maybe it was ',\n",
